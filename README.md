# BlockLagFix
Fixes block lagging

BlockLagFix is a plugin which aims to fix (or atleast reduce to a bare minimum) block lag that can be easily experienced while speed bridging. It reduces the blinking of blocks so it won't be as much noticeable and annoying as before.

Block lagging happens when you try to place blocks too fast consecutive to one on another and that block blinks for a moment. This could be annoying when speed bridging becuase it can make you fall.
